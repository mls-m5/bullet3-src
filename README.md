# bullet3-src

This repository, **bullet3-src**, contains a stripped-down version of the source code from the [Bullet Physics Library](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3). The purpose of this repository is to provide a lightweight, easily accessible version of the Bullet source code that can be quickly downloaded and included in static C++ builds.

The Bullet Physics Library is a powerful, feature-rich physics engine that is widely used in games, simulations, and other interactive applications. However, the full Bullet repository includes various additional assets, examples, and tools that may not be necessary for all projects.

**bullet3-src** addresses this by providing just the essential source code, making it easier to integrate into your own projects. By maintaining this stripped-down version, developers can include the necessary directly into their static C++ builds without having to download extra files and directories. This project is as of writing 17MB compared to 138MB for the full repository.


## Contents

This repository contains the following:

- The `src/` directory, which includes all the essential C++ source files needed to build the Bullet Physics Library.

## How to Use

To include Bullet Physics in your project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mls-m5/bullet3-src
2. Include your prefered files (for example `src/btBulletCollisionAll.cpp`, `src/btBulletDynamicsAll.cpp` and `src/btLinearMathAll.cpp`) in your C++ project's build system.

It should also be possible to use the project using CMake's fetch content.
